Welcome to my GitHub!

I am a front-end programmer who is passionate about technology and constantly learning. Currently, I am focused on the study and practice of React.js, one of the most popular JavaScript libraries today.

In addition, I have solid knowledge in Java thanks to my academic training at UTN. This combination of skills allows me to develop web solutions with a comprehensive vision and a focus on usability and user experience.

On my GitHub you will find projects that reflect my dedication and commitment to quality and innovation in front-end development. Explore my proyects!
